🐍 The re Module in Python
What it is: The re module in Python provides support for regular expressions. 

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns used to match, search, and manipulate strings.

Why we use import re: By importing re, you gain access to functions that let you:

Search for specific text patterns

Validate formats (like emails, phone numbers, postal codes)

Replace or split strings based on patterns

Extract substrings that match complex rules
